# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

Guard Duty collect information from several source like CloudTrail and CloudWatch and performs various analyses against that data using both direct rules and 
machine learning approaches. In the case of the brute force attack, it probably has used information about the network traffic from the VPC Flow Logs and detected
several unsuccessful login attempts in short order from the same IP address.
