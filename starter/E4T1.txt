# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

- disable ssh password authentication on the app server instance
- Update the security group which is assigned to the web application instance. Only allow connections to port 5000 from the public subnet where the application load balancer resides.


# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

1. Implement least privilege access
The instance role policy for the web app instance currently allows all operations on all (*) S3 buckets. Restrict this to read-only access on the FreeRecipes S3 bucket.

2. Apply Default Server-side Encryption to the S3 Bucket
Server-side encryption could be enabled on the secret recipes bucket.
